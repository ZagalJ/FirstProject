# FirstProject

Rec Tunes

Our project consists of a website where people can find their next favorite artist.

There's a search function where you can look up one of your favorite’s artists. 

When you look up an artist, you’re presented with an image related to that artist as well as 10 of their top’s songs, along with 5 similar artists.

You’ll also have access to listen to a 30 second preview of the song as well as a YouTube preview.

This page includes Deezer’s API as well as other API

We used Spectre as our only framework along with some custom CSS.

Along the process of creating this site, we came across multiple roadblocks, everything from dealing with different APIs with terrible documentation, to GIT not allowing us to merge our changes when working with branches.

Our project can be accessed from this page:
